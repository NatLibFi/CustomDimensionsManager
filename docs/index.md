CustomDimensionsManager provides some administrative commands that can be used to manage custom dimensions configuration of multiple sites.

The most important function is the possibility to synchronize custom dimensions configurations of sites.

Synchronization is designed so that it can be run as a cron task that keeps all sites up to date using one site as the source for configuration.
